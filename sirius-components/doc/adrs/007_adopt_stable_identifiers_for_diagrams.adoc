= ADR-007 - Adopt stable identifiers for diagrams

== Context

After the improvements of the ADR 003, we are now keeping identifiers of diagram elements over time.
Those identifiers are still randomly computed.
In order to improve the lifecycle of our diagrams, we should have stable identifiers for diagram elements.

== Decision

=== Diagram

With the improvements of ADR 003, the method `idProvider` on the `DiagramDescription` did not make much sense anymore.
It will thus be removed and the identifier will be computed by the component directly.
We will stop using `GetOrCreateRandomIdProvider` to compute diagram identifiers too.
This class should be removed entirely when the same improvements will be made to the other representations.
The identifier of the diagram will not be provided in the variable manager anymore.
It was not very relevant to give this information to specifiers in the first place.
After all, it does not really make sense to ask specifiers to define a policy to compute internal identifiers of our representations.


=== Node

The identifier of a node will now be computed using:

- The identifier of the parent node or diagram (for root nodes)
- The kind of containment (child node or border node)
- The identifier of the node description used to create the node
- The identifier of the semantic element used to create the node

Using those pieces of information, we will rely on `UUID#.#nameUUIDFromBytes` in order to create a stable identifier which will still remain opaque for the frontend.
Diagrams on the other hand will still have a random UUID since we have no real need for a stable diagram identifier.

The node identifier can now be a proper `UUID`, instead of an `UUID` saved as a `String`, which will impact all the backend code manipulating nodes.
This should not have any impact on the frontend since all identifiers are serialized as strings when defined as GraphQL IDs.
The containment kind of a node will not be defined by a boolean on the props of `NodeComponent` but as a proper enum instead.
Using booleans to express such API can easily cause some confusions.


=== Edge

Edges will have stable identifiers too since they rely on node identifiers to compute their own identifiers.
In a similar fashion as nodes, edges will not need to rely on the `idProvider` of the `EdgeDescription` anymore.
This method will thus be removed.
Finally, the identifier of an edge will now be a proper `UUID` too.


== Status

Accepted.


== Consequences

Labels should switch to an opaque identifier too but it can't be done right now.
The frontend has been "contaminated" since the generation strategy of the label identifier has been copied from the backend.
As a result, various improvements need to be done in the support for the direct edit in order to remove this code.

While refactoring the code, it appeared that `XxxEdgeLabelProvider` on `EdgeDescription` do not make any sense.
Specifiers should not have to arbitrary create diagram elements, just provide information to let the `DiagramRenderer` do it.
Otherwise, they would have to handle countless of tiny details as our API evolve over time.
The creation of labels on edges should rely on the same API as the labels on nodes.
There are no need to have two different APIs for the same need.

One consequence of the rule used to compute node identifier is the a node identity is tied to its parent.
This means that (when we support them), operations which change the visual containment hierarchy of diagram elements will lose the identity of the nodes.
For example, moving a node _A_ inside a new container will create a new node _A'_ which will have a different id.
We will need some mechanism to track these kinds of changes so that the result is as transparent as possible to the user.
In particular, if _A_ and _A'_ use the same node description and style, _A'_ should be created with the same graphical attributes (size, any custom styling) as _A_ to give the user the illusion that the node is "the same" and has just moved.
