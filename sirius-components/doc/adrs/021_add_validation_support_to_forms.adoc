= ADR-021 - Add validation support to forms

== Context

We need to provide validation feedback to the end users.

== Decision

The widgets of the form representation will have some diagnostics data.
For that, the `AbstractWidgetDescription` will be updated in this manner:

```
public class AbstractWidgetDescription {
  Function<VariableManager, List<Object>> diagnosticsProvider;
  Function<Object, String> kindProvider;
  Function<Object, String> messageProvider;
}
```

The representation will thus contain the following data:

```
public class AbstractWidget {
  private List<Diagnostic> diagnostics;
}

public class Diagnostic {
  private UUID id;
  private String kind;
  private String message;
}
```

The frontend will display only the first validation message for now.
The frontend will not leverage the kind of the diagnostic for now either, it will only display a regular MaterialUI error.
We will add a diagnostic on DiagramDescription to check if the domain class is missing.

== Status

WIP

== Consequences

We could add a link and a dialog to display additional messages sometime in the future.
